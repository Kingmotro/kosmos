#Welcome

  Minecraftly is a free and open source (FOSS) Minecraft server-side plugin to automatically create and handle worlds and interactions between multiple infinite Minecraft worlds across multiple server instances, using the least amount of code, CPU, RAM, and configurations as possible. It is designed & produced from scratch by [Viet Nguyen](https://vi.et), with assistance from friends, developers and helpers from the internet. Minecraftly is now community-developed and will be remained free under [GNU GPLv3](LICENSE) license.
  
  Minecraftly is compatible with most infrastructures, including but not limited to:
  - Single machine
  - Multiple machine cluster
  - Cloud computing infrastructure
  - Containers

##Concepts
- Player joins via {their_username}.{domain}.{tld}:
  - [x] if joins for the first time, server creates the world
  - [x] world has the folder format name {uuid}
  - [x] it contains world contents like usual (world, world_nether, world_the_end, session.lock, etc...)
  - [x] only owner of the world can create the world
  - [x] other players can only load the world if available.
  - [x] worlds are stored in the pre defined folder ~/minecraft/worlds/{uuid}
  - [x] ~/minecraft/worlds folder is shared across all spigot servers
  - [ ] player data will be in the common folder ~/minecraft/playerdata, shared across all spigot servers
  - [ ] achievement stats will be in the common folder ~/minecraft/stats, shared across all spigot servers
  - [x] works with {domain}.{tld} or simply the proxy IP address
  - [x] default game mode for world owner is SURVIVAL
  - [x] Default game rule changes for all worlds:
    - [x] keepInventory: true
    - [x] mobGriefing: false
- Player joins via {another_player_username}.m.ly
  - [x] proxy checks player's UUID
  - [x] check if the world's UUID is already loaded on any server
  - [x] proxy brings player to the server with world already loaded
  - [x] else, brings player to any server and load world via that server
  - [x] Default game mode for visitor of a world is ADVENTURE
    - [ ] Players with ADVENTURE mode can't open chests
- Trust a player to build in your world
  - [x] Owner of world can trust others to build
  - [x] The trusted player will have game mode changed from ADVENTURE to SURVIVAL for that world only.
  - [x] Trust command: /trust {username_you_want_to_trust}
  - [x] Trust list command: /trustlist
  - [x] Untrust command: untrust {username_you_want_to_untrust}
- [ ] Location handling
  - [ ] If player joins via IP address or normal {domain}.{tld} -> brings player to previous logout location on previous world
  - [ ] If player joins explicitly via {subdomain}.{domain}.{tld} -> bring player to previous logout location of that specific world
- Spawn point
  - [x] /setspawn: Set your world's spawn at your standing location in your world
    - [x] Everyone who joins your world for the first time, including you, will spawn here
    - [ ] If you die, you will spawn back here if you don't set a home location
    - If anyone else die in your world, they will spawn back here
  - [x] /spawn: Go back to your spawn point instantly
    - [x] Everyone, including you, in your world who types this command will teleport to the spawn point of your world.
- Home location
  - [x] /sethome: Set your home location at your standing location in your world
    - [x] Only you are able to set home in your world
    - [ ] When you die, you will spawn back here
  - [x] /home
    - [x] You go to your home location
    - [x] You can use this command when you are on any world
    - [x] If using this command while playing in another world, check if the world's UUID is already loaded on any server

#Redis key-value store database structure
Redis key-value store is for use for queueing, bringing players to the right place at the right time, whether it's join, teleport, or other related events.

uuid (table)
- For UUID caching
- Because Mojang has an API limit of only 10 per minute.

 | uuid  | username
 | --- | --- | --- |
 | 0cc87f4b-6b4a-404f-b11d-db2e76a24243 | AsianGuy_Gamer |
 | c088272e-a8ca-496c-91a2-b7394ffe879c | ImRainbowActive |
 | cf1f1ea8-4bc9-4cba-886c-33997403eb80 | AruAkise_ |
 | ... | ... | ... |

world (table)
- Showing which world is currently loaded by which server.
- If a world is already/currently loaded on one server, subsequent player who joins via subdomain will go to correct server.
- This will prevent world being loaded twice on many different spigot servers
- IP and port columns will use Spigot's server.properties' server-ip and server-port values

 | world  | address |
 | --- | --- |
 | 00ceaed3-3715-49e9-b45f-0e01cf94f798 | 10.240.0.1:25566 |

 | 00f6795c-8409-4efb-a5e8-ef94f51e68dc | 10.240.0.3:25568 |
 | ... | ... |

server (table)
- Showing which Spigot servers are currently running correctly
- This acts as BungeeCord's dynamic config to list the available servers
- It helps handling join event via BungeeCord after sessions login, not subsequent join from server to server.
- IP and port columns will use Spigot's server.properties' server-ip and server-port values
- "players" column shows number of players currently online inside that Spigot server.
- BungeeCord server will base on this to bring players to the Spigot server with least number of players currently online.
- This feature will be ignore if a player is joining a specific world with specific players currently online on that world, instead it will use "world" table to route players correctly instead.

 | address | players |
 | --- | --- |
 | 10.240.0.1:25566 | 43 |
 | 10.240.0.2:25567 | 7 |
 | 10.240.0.3:25568 | 56 |
 | ... | ... |

player (table)
- List all players online with their current server IP and port
- For teleporting player to player correctly
- IP and port columns will use Spigot's server.properties' server-ip and server-port values

 | uuid  | address |
 | --- | --- |
 | 0cc87f4b-6b4a-404f-b11d-db2e76a24243 | 10.240.0.1:25566 |

##Minecraftly config
Minecraftly proxy and server plugins' config is very simple. You only need to define a database credentials. That's it!

```yaml
redis:
  host: 127.0.0.1
  port: 6379
  password: ''
mysql:
  host: 127.0.0.1
  port: 3306
  database: minecraftly
  username: root
  password: ''
```

---

##Spigot server config
Here are a few things that need changes in the config of Spigot Minecraft server to make things work. Most of the configurations are very standard, just double check and make sure that "server-ip" and "server-port" are defined correctly.

- server.properties
```yaml
  server-ip={the public or private server IP that is attached to your machine}
  server-port={whatever port you want}
  online-mode=false
```

- bukkit.yml
```yaml
  connection-throttle: -1
```

- spigot.yml
```yaml
  bungeecord: true
```

---

##Spigot Startup Script

Startup script for startup must have the "--world-dir /{folder location}" [start-up parameter](https://www.spigotmc.org/wiki/start-up-parameters/), so that all spigot servers can share the same collection of worlds.

For example:

```powershell
java -jar spigot.jar --world-dir /minecraft/worlds
```

---

##Compiling
Minecraftly is distributed as a [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) project. To compile it and install it in your local Maven repository:

```git
apt-get install git -y
apt-get install maven -y
git clone https://github.com/minecraftly/minecraftly.git
cd minecraftly
mvn clean install
```

---

##Build Minecraftly plugin on Jenkins

- Freestyle project name
  - minecraftly

- Branches to build
  - Branch Specifier (blank for 'any'): master

- Source Code Management
  - Choose "Git"
  - Repository URL: https://github.com/minecraftly/minecraftly.git

- Build
  - Execute shell command: mvn clean install
  
- Post-build Actions

##How to describe Minecraftly
- Tumblr for Minecraft
- Wordpress Multisite for Minecraft
- A Minecraft server within a server

---

##Uniqueness
- Individual server per player.
- Accessible via player username: (username).m.ly
- If a player changes username, the server will map to that subdomain accordingly.
- Same plugins as everyone else, good for leaderboards, ranks, etc...
- Servers are always on, no need to "startup on demand", or "stop when inactive".
- Players can have control of their server. The player is partially OP'd when they login to their server. They have access to:
- 1. Kick, Ban, Mute others
- 2. Whitelist their server
- 3. Reset their world, while keeping their inventories.
- Teleportation cross servers
- No slots limit.

##Why Open Source?
  I'm [Viet](https://twitter.com/vietdoge), a simple guy with love for cloud computing, the web, technologies, and Minecraft just like you. Ever since I first run a Minecraft server in 2012, I've always been looking for a way to scale Minecraft with high availability and fault tolerant. It took me years to think and build the first prototype after seeing that not many people in the community have a high availability mindset. I can't do it alone and need your contribution to make it better.

  Started out as a simple Minecraft game server like every other, I understood that Minecraft and open world games have limitation in connections. I saw that it needs something that can handle connections and allows Minecraft to scale incredibly far with limited resources. So I created Minecraftly. It took over a year to develop the first prototype. It's now open source. I'm glad to share the technology with passionate people who want to contribute to the community, to change the world via cloud computing, and with everyone who wants to learn about high availability architecture.

  I dedicated myself to cloud computing and passed my AWS Solutions Architect Certification exam in 2015. It helped construct my knowledge to build a simplier open source project that anyone can test, build, host their own network.

##Parallel Space Partitioning:
 In most MMORPG games like World of Warcraft or Minecraft, or Second Life, to scale and serve massive amount of concurrent players, parallel space partitioning needs to be applied.
 
 Normally, space partitioning refers to the dividing of a game into multiple worlds, handled by each separated servers.

 Minecraftly goes above and beyond that. We divide the game into multiple worlds as well, but assigned to each separated players, handled by any servers in the cluster. Luckily, the nature of the Minecraft as an open world game allows that to happen.

---

##Architecture
 Usually, in a traditional Minecraft server, player flow is like this:
 
<img src="https://m.ly/images/8hGSRpe.svg" width="100%"/>
 
 Above is the old ways of handling players. It's too monolithic. Bottleneck usually happens when a single machine gets filled up with high amount of concurrent players.
 
Now, let's visualize another way to distribute players, where server is seperated from world files. In Minecraftly, it's like this:
 
<img src="https://m.ly/images/ykl5mnN.svg" width="100%"/>

Each player has their own world that they control, accessible via their own public address. The beautiful thing is that all players can interact with others normally.

##Requirements
 * BungeeCord: serve as a proxy server (equivalent to Nginx or HAProxy in web hosting)
 * Spigot: serve as Minecraft server. Spigot is important because it has "--world-dir" flag at startup, which specifies the directory for all world maps.
 * MySQL server: Necessary database.
